# CP-Learning_Resources
This is a collection of links, blogs and problems etc that I have used to understand and learn new Data Structures, Algorithms and Techniques in Competitive Programming.

1. [**CP-Algorithms.com**](cp-algorithms.com) (Best resource ever with almost all important topics with brief & precise explanation and code. :orange_heart:)
1. [Fenwick Tree](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree/)
1. [DP on Trees](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20935)
1. [Centroid Decomposition](https://www.quora.com/q/threadsiiithyderabad/Centroid-Decomposition-of-a-Tree) 
1. [Grundy Numbers and Nim](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66040)
1. [Suffix Array](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2)
1. [FFT](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/43499)

Some topics, DP in particular, can only be understood well by solving problems, these are some problems that I believe are very educating.
