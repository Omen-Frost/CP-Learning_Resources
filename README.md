# CP-Learning_Resources
This is a collection of links, blogs and problems etc that I have used to understand and learn new Data Structures, Algorithms and Techniques in Competitive Programming. This file is not relevant for those preparing for interviews and stuff...

1. [**CP-Algorithms.com**](cp-algorithms.com) (Best resource ever with almost all important topics with brief & precise explanation and code. :orange_heart:)

Some topics, DP in particular, can only be understood well by solving problems, these are some problems that I believe are very educating.


1. Dp:
